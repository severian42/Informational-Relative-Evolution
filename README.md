# Information Relative Evolution (IRE)

## Overview

Welcome to the **Information Relative Evolution (IRE)** repository. This repository serves as the central hub for research, simulations, and theoretical developments based on the **IRE principle**, a framework that treats information coherence as a dynamic physical field. Here, you'll find:

- **Simulations** of the IRE-predicted dynamics, including applications to the **three-body problem**.

- **Mathematical derivations** and publications on the IRE field equation.

- **Code and data** for running IRE-based computational models.

## What is IRE?

The **Information Relative Evolution (IRE) principle** proposes that **information coherence** is an active, physical entity influencing the evolution of complex systems. Unlike classical physics, which treats information passively (as a record of physical states), IRE posits that structured information behaves like a field, obeying its own evolution equations derived from fundamental physics.

### The IRE Field Equation:

The core equation governing the IRE field is:

### Information Coherence Field Equation
```bash
‚àÇ¬≤œà/‚àÇt¬≤ + Œ≥ ‚àÇœà/‚àÇt - ‚àá ¬∑ [ D‚ÇÄ (1 + Œ±œà¬≤)(1 + Œ≤C(t)) ‚àáœà ] + Œª sgn(œà) [ log(|œà| + Œµ) + 1 ] - Œª‚Çô‚Çó ‚à´ dùë•' K(ùë• - ùë•') œà(ùë•', t) = 0
```
#### Where:
- **œà(x, t)** represents the **information coherence field**.  
- **D‚ÇÄ, Œ±, Œ≤** control **local and global diffusion properties**.  
- **C(t)** is the **global coherence function**.  
- **Œª, Œª‚Çô‚Çó** introduce **entropy-driven self-organization and nonlocal interactions**.  
- **Œ≥** accounts for **dissipation**, stabilizing the system over time.  

Here is a quick 3-min podcast that explains the entire framework in a high-level manner.

### Real-World Applications of IRE:

IRE provides a **unified theoretical framework** that links fundamental physics, thermodynamics, and information theory. It helps explain spontaneous structure formation in a variety of systems, including:

- **Neural Networks & Brain Activity**: The IRE field equation can model how structured information propagates through neural networks, explaining synchronization in brain wave activity and emergent cognition patterns.
  
- **Weather Patterns & Climate Systems**: The equation's nonlinear diffusion properties resemble atmospheric circulation dynamics, helping to describe how coherent weather structures (such as hurricanes or jet streams) emerge from chaotic interactions.

- **Stock Market & Economic Fluctuations**: In financial systems, IRE helps model how information coherence propagates through markets, influencing asset price synchronization and economic cycles.

- **Biological Evolution & Morphogenesis**: IRE predicts how genetic and epigenetic information self-organizes, explaining stable yet adaptive biological pattern formations (such as animal coat patterns and cellular organization).

- **Galaxy Formation & Cosmology**: The resonance and nonlocal effects embedded in the equation provide insights into large-scale structure formation in the universe, explaining why galaxies tend to organize in filaments and clusters.

### Why is This Important?

IRE provides a **unified theoretical framework** that links fundamental physics, thermodynamics, and information theory. By treating information coherence as an evolving field, IRE helps explain the spontaneous emergence of structure in everything from quantum systems to galaxies.
