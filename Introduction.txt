Introduction
What is the fundamental role of information in the physical universe? Traditional scientific paradigms treat information as a descriptive or mathematical tool – a way to keep track of states, measure uncertainty, or summarize correlations. Under standard assumptions, information is passive: it records how matter and energy are arranged but is not usually considered an active component of physical dynamics. The Information Relative Evolution (IRE) principle is a bold new proposition that challenges this view. In essence, the IRE principle posits that information – specifically the coherence of information – is a real, physical facet of the universe, one that actively shapes and influences the evolution of physical systems. This means that information is not merely an abstract bookkeeping of what particles are where; instead, the structured information within a system has tangible effects, much like forces or fields, guiding how the system changes over time.
Defining the IRE principle more formally: it asserts that every physical system is accompanied by an informational coherence field representing the degree of organization or meaningful structure in that system. The evolution of the system is relative to (and intertwined with) the state of this information field. In plainer terms, the coherence of information – how well information hangs together in patterns – plays a causative role in physical processes, not just a reflective one. High informational coherence (for example, a highly ordered arrangement or correlated pattern) can influence the system to evolve differently than it would if that information were disordered or random. According to IRE, this information field obeys its own evolution equations, analogous to how electromagnetic or gravitational fields evolve, and it in turn affects the matter and energy fields. The IRE principle thus elevates information to a physical entity, suggesting that the universe’s structure is co-created by informational patterns along with traditional forces.
This perspective is a fundamental shift. It challenges the standard assumption that information has no dynamics of its own and no reality independent of the physical state. In conventional physics, if we know the positions and velocities of particles (the information about the system), we can predict future states using laws of motion – but the information itself (as a quantity of order or knowledge) is just a derived notion. IRE, by contrast, contends that information itself participates in dynamics. It’s as if the patterns and order in a system exert a kind of influence, a bit like an invisible hand shaping how things play out. This means treating concepts like “pattern”, “order”, and “coherence” not just as subjective descriptions, but as something like an energy field or a substance that the universe recognizes and responds to. The motivation for this radical idea comes from multiple converging insights in science and philosophy that increasingly point to information being fundamental. For instance, in the 20th century Rolf Landauer famously demonstrated that erasing a single bit of information has a measurable energetic cost (releasing a tiny amount of heat), which “proves information is more than just a mathematical quantity” and firmly connects information to energy​

. In Landauer’s words and subsequent work, information is physical​

– it has real consequences in the material world. Likewise, physicist John Archibald Wheeler advocated the slogan “it from bit,” suggesting that every physical “it” (every particle, field, or event) derives its existence from informational binary choices at root. As Wheeler put it, “all things physical are information-theoretic in origin”​
philpapers.org
, implying that what we call reality fundamentally arises from information. These ideas laid groundwork by arguing that information is not just an abstract human construct, but something woven into the fabric of reality.
The IRE principle builds on this foundation and goes a step further: it says not only is information fundamental, but specifically the coherence or structured aspect of information carries physical weight. In other words, it’s not just bits in isolation that matter, but how bits relate to each other to form meaningful wholes. By treating informational coherence as a physical reality, IRE provides a new lens to view the universe – one where patterns themselves possess a form of agency. This is a philosophical shift as much as a scientific one. It compels us to reconsider what we mean by “fundamental.” We are used to thinking of fundamental entities as particles, fields, forces, energy, etc. IRE suggests adding organized information patterns to that list. It invites us to imagine, for example, that the reason a complex system (like a living cell or a galaxy) maintains its form and evolves as it does might be partly because of an underlying information-field that holds the pattern together and guides it, much as a magnetic field guides iron filings into alignment.
By treating information coherence as a physically real field rather than a mere descriptor, the IRE principle aims to unify our understanding of complex organization in the universe. This approach is motivated by a recognition that many phenomena – from the emergence of life’s complexity to the synchronized firing of neurons in the brain, from stable crystal growth to the formation of cosmic structure – seem to involve an interplay of local interactions and global order that is not easily explained by traditional physics alone. Standard physics excels at local cause-and-effect: one particle pushes another, one planet gravitates toward a star. But when it comes to highly organized systems, we often find it useful to talk about patterns: for example, the way a pattern of chemical concentrations forms spots on an animal’s coat, or how a dissipative structure like a hurricane maintains its organized vortex. The IRE principle formalizes that intuition by asserting that those patterns (the information in the arrangement) behave as a field with its own evolution equation, much like temperature or electromagnetic fields have their governing equations. In doing so, IRE provides a framework that could bridge disciplines – linking physics, information theory, biology, and even philosophy – under a common idea: that information matters, in the most profound sense. It is no longer relegated to the sidelines as a bookkeeping device, but brought onto center stage as a prime mover in the story of the cosmos.
In summary, the Introduction of the IRE principle lays out a new paradigm: information coherence is real, dynamic, and influential. This stands in contrast to the long-held assumption that information is incidental. The rest of this document will delve into the meaning of this principle in detail, explain its conceptual underpinnings, contrast it with existing scientific frameworks, illustrate how it works with intuitive examples, and explore its far-reaching implications – from fundamental physics to consciousness and cosmology. By the end, we aim to show why adopting the IRE perspective is not only plausible, but potentially transformative for our understanding of the structure of reality.
Fundamental Concepts
To grasp the Information Relative Evolution principle deeply, we must unpack its core concepts. At the heart of IRE is a simple but profound idea: information is not just a passive record of what happens; it is an active structuring force in its own right. In everyday terms, we usually think of information as something like a book’s content – the book’s pages have words (information) that describe a story, but the story itself can’t push the book or change the physical world. IRE invites us to imagine, by analogy, that if the information in the book were coherent and self-organizing enough, it could actually influence physical events – as if the story could reach out of the pages and guide how the book is put together or how it interacts with the environment. While this analogy is fanciful, it points to the key notion of IRE: informational patterns have efficacy. Specifically, coherent information (i.e. information that forms an organized, non-random pattern) tends to promote and sustain structure in physical systems, whereas incoherent information (completely random data or noise) does not.
Let us clarify what we mean by information coherence. Coherence, in this context, refers to how ordered, correlated, or meaningful a set of information is. If we think of information as a message or arrangement, coherence measures to what extent the pieces of that arrangement form a consistent whole. A random scattering of ink on paper has low coherence (no clear pattern or meaning), whereas the carefully arranged ink forming letters and words in a Shakespearean sonnet has high coherence (the letters form words, the words form sentences conveying rich meaning). Similarly, in a physical system, we could say a crystal has high information coherence because its atoms are arranged in a very orderly, repeating pattern, whereas a gas has low coherence (molecules flying randomly). IRE postulates that we can describe the distribution of information coherence in space and time using a field – the informational coherence field. This field essentially assigns a value at every point in space (and moment in time) that represents the “density of organized information” or the level of informational order at that location​
file-yxpvw1uluawnerq4wcfztc
. A higher field value means that region has a lot of structured, correlated information (for example, a highly organized structure or pattern), while a lower value means the information there is more random or uncorrelated.
Crucially, this informational coherence field is not just a mathematical abstraction; in IRE it is considered as real and as dynamic as an electromagnetic field. Just as an electromagnetic field can exist in space, carry energy, and affect charged particles, an informational coherence field exists wherever there are patterns, carries a form of “organizational energy,” and can affect how physical processes unfold. One way to visualize this is to imagine a kind of invisible ocean of information that permeates a system. Where the water (information) is calm and uniformly mixed, nothing interesting happens. But where currents and whirlpools of information form – that is, where information becomes structured into currents – those currents can carry along material objects and influence their motion. In a sense, the informational coherence field is like a current of organization flowing through a system, coaxing matter and energy into particular configurations. It’s an active background that guides the foreground physical events.
This concept is essential for understanding complex systems. Why? Because many complex systems exhibit emergent behaviors that seem to transcend the sum of their parts. A classic example is a flock of birds turning in unison. Each bird is following simple rules (like “align with neighbors”), but the flock as a whole exhibits a beautiful, coherent motion – almost as if an invisible hand (or field of coordination) is guiding them. In IRE terms, we would say the flock has a high informational coherence field that has formed: information about direction and speed is shared and aligned across the group, creating a coherent state (all birds moving as one pattern). That coherence then influences each bird’s behavior (since each responds to the group alignment), reinforcing the overall pattern. In effect, the pattern itself (the shape and movement of the flock) is acting like a field influencing the individual birds. This is not far from how physicists sometimes treat systems: for instance, in magnetism, we speak of a magnetic field that aligns spinning electrons. The electrons create the magnetic field by aligning, but the field in turn pushes other electrons to align, creating a self-reinforcing loop of order. Similarly, an informational coherence field can be self-reinforcing: local parts create global patterns, which then encourage local parts to maintain that pattern.
To make these ideas more concrete, IRE introduces the notion of an informational coherence field mathematically as a field $\psi(x,t)$ defined at each point $x$ in space and time $t$. We can think of $\psi(x,t)$ as a function that measures how much structured information is present at point $x$ and time $t$. If $\psi$ is large, that region is in a very organized state; if $\psi$ is near zero or minimal, that region is disordered. For example, imagine shining a laser light versus a normal light bulb. Laser light is highly coherent (the light waves are in sync), so if we had an informational coherence field for the light, the laser’s region would have a high $\psi$ value. The light bulb emits incoherent light (waves out of sync, random phases), so its $\psi$ would be low. Now, the IRE principle says that this $\psi(x,t)$ field not only exists but evolves according to certain laws, and in turn can influence the physical entities (the birds, the electrons, the atoms, etc.). In other words, $\psi(x,t)$ has its own dynamics, much like how the temperature in a room evolves (spreading from hot to cold regions) or how a wave on a string evolves over time.
What kind of “laws” does informational coherence obey? While a complete mathematical description is advanced, at a conceptual level IRE borrows ideas from several well-known physical processes to build an analogy for information. Specifically, we expect the information coherence field to have properties akin to: wave propagation, diffusion, self-organization drive, and feedback (resonance), all tempered by dissipation. Let’s break that down:
* Information as a Wave: Just as physical disturbances can travel as waves (think of how a jolt on one end of a rope travels to the other end), disturbances or changes in information coherence can propagate through the field. For example, a sudden introduction of order in one part of a system (say a new pattern that forms) might send out ripples of influence that carry that information outward. In a pond, if you drop a pebble, ripples (waves) move outward. Analogously, if a new bit of organized structure appears in a material, perhaps the IRE field carries that influence outward as an informational wave. This is akin to signals moving through a medium of information. In more technical language, IRE assumes that the coherence field $\psi$ allows disturbances to travel – much like solutions of wave equations in physics​
file-yxpvw1uluawnerq4wcfztc
. This is important because it means information is not stuck where it started; it can move and spread its influence, allowing different parts of a system to coordinate.
* Information Diffusion: Alongside wave-like behavior, information coherence can also diffuse or spread out, especially when there are gradients (differences) in coherence between regions. Diffusion is a smoothing process – it tends to make concentrated things spread into less concentrated areas (like perfume scent diffusing through a room). If one region has a very high coherence (a lot of structure) and a neighboring region is low (chaotic), there may be a natural tendency for some of that coherence to bleed out into the disordered region, spreading the order. This is analogous to how a drop of ink spreads in water. However, IRE postulates nonlinear diffusion for information: the rate and way information spreads might depend on the state of the information field itself​
file-yxpvw1uluawnerq4wcfztc
. For instance, it might spread quickly when coherence is moderate but slow down when regions become fully saturated with order (just as in some chemical systems, diffusion can depend on concentration). This captures the intuition that information sometimes self-limits – highly ordered structures can be stable and not just wash out completely, because the medium itself changes its properties when saturated with order. Nonlinear diffusion is essential in pattern formation (it’s a key part of Turing’s theory for how animal coat patterns form, where chemicals diffuse at rates depending on local concentrations). By including it, IRE acknowledges that information spreading is not a simple linear process; the context matters. An informational coherence field thus can smooth out small irregularities but also maintain sharp patterns if the conditions are right.
* Entropy-Driven Self-Organization: Perhaps the most counterintuitive yet crucial aspect is that the information field incorporates a drive toward self-organization. In physics, we associate increasing entropy (disorder) with the natural tendency of closed systems – things fall apart, mix together, and randomness increases per the second law of thermodynamics. How, then, can order increase or persist? The key is that many systems are open or driven – they exchange energy or matter with their environment, allowing them to create pockets of order while overall entropy (including environment) increases. IRE’s informational coherence field is formulated to reflect an energy landscape or potential that rewards organized configurations. In plainer terms, the laws governing $\psi$ are such that it tends to settle into states that represent higher coherence (if conditions allow), akin to how a ball rolls down into a valley in a landscape. This can be thought of as an entropy-related potential: it doesn’t violate thermodynamics; rather, it works with it by locally reducing free energy or entropy production, leading to structure, while expelling disorder elsewhere​
file-yxpvw1uluawnerq4wcfztc
. This concept aligns with ideas from non-equilibrium thermodynamics – for example, the work of Ilya Prigogine and others who showed that dissipative structures can emerge in far-from-equilibrium systems, forming temporary order out of chaos by using energy flows​file-yxpvw1uluawnerq4wcfztc. The IRE field essentially encodes this principle: it has a built-in tendency to generate and maintain coherent information structures when energy is available to do so. Thus, information is not just blowing in the wind; it actively seeks structure in a way analogous to how physical systems can self-organize under the right conditions (like how heat flows can spontaneously organize into convection cells).
* Feedback and Resonance: Another fundamental concept in IRE is resonance – the idea that certain informational patterns can amplify themselves through feedback. In physical systems, resonance occurs when a system is driven at just the right frequency so that each push adds on to the previous (like pushing a swing at the right rhythm to make it go higher). For information coherence, this translates to the notion that if a pattern “fits” well with the system’s dynamics, it can reinforce itself and grow stronger, whereas patterns that don’t fit will fade away. The IRE field equations include terms that allow for the spontaneous amplification of certain modes or patterns if conditions favor them​
file-yxpvw1uluawnerq4wcfztc
. In practical terms, imagine a scenario with many possible patterns (like many possible modes of vibration or arrangement); the ones that resonate – that find positive feedback – will dominate. This is how nature selects patterns: for example, when a fluid is heated from below (the classic Bénard convection experiment), many patterns of flow are possible, but eventually the fluid “picks” a particular size of convection cell to form because that pattern resonates best with the balance of forces. In IRE, because information is an active field, it too will have preferred “modes” or coherent structures that are naturally favored because they reinforce the underlying physical processes. We might call these “eigenpatterns” of the information field. This resonance aspect explains why we often see distinct structures rather than random fluctuations – e.g., why galaxies have spiral arms of certain shapes, or why brainwaves have specific frequency bands that dominate (alpha waves, beta waves, etc., could be seen as resonant modes of neural informational coherence).
* Dissipation (Stability Control): Last but not least, IRE acknowledges that no real system can have unchecked growth of patterns without limit; there are always dissipative processes that sap energy and prevent wild oscillations or infinite build-up. In the information field, dissipation plays the role of damping out incoherent fluctuations and very high-frequency changes, acting as a stabilizer​
file-yxpvw1uluawnerq4wcfztc
. It’s analogous to friction in a physical system. Without dissipation, a resonance could grow until it destroys the system or leads to unrealistic infinities. With dissipation, the information field’s patterns reach a balance and can settle into stable or cyclic structures. Think of it like this: if information patterns are waves and oscillations of a sort, dissipation is what eventually calms them or keeps them finite, ensuring that the coherent structures that do emerge are robust. In everyday terms, a system may try many patterns (fluctuations of the info field), but only those that can withstand dissipative losses (i.e., are efficient at maintaining themselves) will persist. This ensures the coherence field doesn’t run away but instead reaches an equilibrium or steady dynamical state consistent with physical constraints (like energy available, etc.).
All these aspects – wave propagation, diffusion, self-organization potential, resonance feedback, and dissipation – are integrated in the IRE framework. They collectively imply that the informational coherence field behaves in a rich way: it can spread and communicate information, smooth or sharpen patterns, encourage the formation of order, select certain patterns to grow, and damp out irregularities. In fact, the formal derivations of IRE (beyond the scope of this conceptual discussion) show that one can write down an equation for the $\psi(x,t)$ field that looks like a unification of several classic equations in physics and chemistry. In the technical paper underpinning IRE, the resulting field equation “unifies wave propagation, nonlinear diffusion, entropy-driven organization, and resonance into a coherent framework”​
file-yxpvw1uluawnerq4wcfztc
. This is very much by design: the creators of the IRE principle wanted a single theoretical structure that captures the essence of how complex, self-organizing patterns arise and persist in nature.
To use a metaphor, think of the informational coherence field as a kind of landscape or medium and information itself as something that can flow and clump within that medium. The rules outlined above are like saying: in this landscape, information can flow like water (waves and diffusion), it can crystallize or form whirlpools under the right conditions (self-organization and resonance), and there is some friction in the land (dissipation) to prevent unrealistic behavior. The net result is that the information in a system will tend to form coherent streams and pools rather than remain uniformly mixed or totally chaotic. Those streams and pools of information correspond to the patterns and structures we actually observe in the world – whether it’s a biological structure, a pattern of electrical activity, or a stable social structure. IRE gives a name to this hidden order: the informational coherence field.
In more philosophical terms, this approach blurs the line between the physical and the informational. It suggests that whenever we see a pattern – which is information – that pattern has a kind of field existence with dynamics of its own. This is why we earlier said information is an active agent. It’s active because these field dynamics will make things happen; for example, a coherence field might cause matter to arrange into a certain pattern (like guiding molecules to crystallize in a particular form) because the field represents that pattern and “wants” to actualize it. While traditional physics can certainly explain crystallization without invoking an info field (using energy minimization, etc.), IRE provides an alternative, arguably more general viewpoint: energy minimization and information coherence maximization are two sides of the same coin. In fact, one might say IRE bridges energy and information, uniting them in one description. Energy tells us what configurations are favored physically; information coherence tells us what configurations are meaningful or ordered; in a deep sense, IRE implies these are intimately linked. A system finds a configuration that is both low in energy and high in informational coherence – hence stable and patterned.
To ensure clarity, let’s employ a metaphor or two as promised, maintaining scientific rigor but offering intuition. Consider an old idea from biology: the “morphogenetic field.” Developmental biologists once imagined that, as an embryo develops, there are fields that guide cells to form arms, legs, eyes in the right places – fields of information that shape the embryo’s form. While the modern understanding attributes this to genes and chemical gradients, the IRE concept is reminiscent of a morphogenetic field but generalized to all systems. It’s as if every system has a morphogenetic field of information coherence that guides its form and behavior. Now consider a less biological metaphor: a musical orchestra. In an orchestra, dozens of musicians play together. What ensures that their sounds don’t clash chaotically but instead produce a symphony? The sheet music (information) and the conductor (coordinating signal) ensure coherence. The IRE field in a complex system plays a role analogous to both the sheet music and the conductor – it embodies the “score” (the pattern to be played) and it propagates signals to keep parts in sync. If each musician (each part of the system) just played independently without listening or referring to the score, you’d get noise (disorder). But with an active informational guidance, you get harmony (order). In a physical system, the parts “listen” to the informational coherence field – not consciously of course, but in effect – and thus can act in concert. The result is an emergent order that is robust and can adapt if conditions change (just as a symphony can change tempo or key if the conductor signals it).
Through these metaphors, we see that treating information as an active structuring force is not a mystical idea but a way to capture how complex coordination happens in nature. We often use informational language informally: “DNA is a blueprint,” “cells communicate,” “social media spreads information shaping public opinion,” etc. IRE gives these phrases literal significance in physics. The blueprint (information) in DNA doesn’t just sit there – it actively guides the assembly of the organism (it’s part of an information field that includes mRNA, proteins, etc., guiding development). Neurons “communicating” create brain-wide waves of activity – literal physical waves of the coherence field of neural information. Social information spreading in a network creates large-scale coherent movements (trends, mass actions) which then influence individuals. In each case, information has causal power in a distributed way.
By establishing the fundamental concepts of IRE – the informational coherence field and its wave-like, diffusive, self-organizing, resonant, and dissipative character – we have a platform to compare this new paradigm with the established scientific frameworks that preceded it. Before we do that, let’s succinctly summarize: information in IRE is an active field that structures reality, not a passive reflection of it. It captures the coherence of a system – the degree to which parts act in unison or form meaningful patterns – and this field evolves through its own laws, influencing matter and energy. This duality changes how we might approach any complex system: instead of just asking “what are the particles and forces doing?”, IRE encourages us to also ask “what is the information field doing, and how is it shaping the outcome?”. With this in mind, we can now contrast IRE with classical, quantum, and thermodynamic paradigms, to highlight both the continuity and the novelty of this principle.
Contrasting IRE with Existing Paradigms
The Information Relative Evolution principle touches on ideas that appear in classical mechanics, quantum physics, and thermodynamics – but it rearranges their emphasis and extends them into new territory. To appreciate what IRE offers, it’s useful to compare it to these established paradigms and see where it aligns, where it diverges, and how it potentially unifies concepts across them.
IRE vs. Classical Mechanics: Classical Newtonian mechanics (and classical field theory) is primarily about matter and energy moving and interacting in space and time. In classical physics, if you know the initial conditions (the positions, velocities, etc., which is essentially the information about the system at the start) and the forces at play, you can calculate the future behavior. However, classical physics itself doesn’t assign any independent status to “information” – information is just a way for us to describe the system. The system’s evolution is determined by forces (gravity, electromagnetism, etc.) acting locally. There is no notion of an information field that actively steers things; the only “field” is something like a gravitational or electromagnetic field which influences matter directly. IRE, in contrast, introduces an additional element – the informational coherence field – which has no place in traditional classical mechanics. One might think of it as analogous to a new kind of field, but one that represents pattern rather than a standard force. Importantly, IRE doesn’t throw away classical mechanics; rather, it builds on it. For instance, when we said earlier that the IRE field can propagate waves, that is reminiscent of classical wave equations (like vibrations on a string or sound waves). When we talk about diffusion of information, it’s reminiscent of classical diffusion of particles or heat. In fact, the mathematical form of the IRE field’s evolution draws on classical field equations – it can be formulated via a Lagrangian (an action principle) just like a classical field theory​
file-yxpvw1uluawnerq4wcfztc
, ensuring that it is consistent with fundamental symmetries and conservation laws in physics. What IRE adds to classical thinking is the idea that there is a new state variable for a system: not just position and momentum of particles, but the information coherence level $\psi(x,t)$. This variable influences the particles and can be influenced by them.
To contrast concretely: In classical mechanics, if you have, say, a bunch of pendulum clocks on a wall, each will tick independently unless some physical coupling causes them to synchronize (like the vibration through the wall). In IRE terms, the information about phase and frequency of each clock can form a coherence field; if one clock falls into sync with another, that coherence is information that can propagate through the system, helping to synchronize all clocks even with minimal coupling. In classical terms, you’d search for a physical medium (sound pulses in the wall) that cause synchronization. In IRE, you’d say the clocks share information and spontaneously synchronize by maximizing coherence (a kind of self-organization of information). While classical mechanics might require an explicit force to do this, IRE suggests that information coherence itself behaves somewhat like a force. It’s a subtle distinction – after all, one could always translate the IRE effect back into “some force we didn’t account for” – but the paradigm shift is in what we consider fundamental. Classical physics fundamentally doesn’t care about “meaningful patterns” or “coherence” per se; IRE says we should care, because the universe might.
Another classical notion is the increase of entropy. In classical thermodynamics (which overlaps with mechanics conceptually), we expect closed systems to move toward disorder. IRE defies the inevitability of local disorder by positing that the information field can locally counteract it (using energy inputs). This doesn’t violate classical laws if the system is open, but it highlights something classical mechanics rarely emphasizes: the export of entropy and import of information. A classical engineer might analyze a refrigerator and just follow energy flows; an IRE perspective would explicitly follow information flows as well, seeing, for example, the structured motion of coolant as an information pattern that is maintained and propagated (thus keeping the fridge interior ordered at the expense of external entropy increase).
In summary, compared to classical mechanics, IRE extends the framework by adding a new layer (the information coherence field) on top of the usual physical quantities. It challenges the classical assumption that only tangible forces matter by suggesting that informational structure can be seen as an effective force. However, it does so in a way that is compatible with classical ideas: waves, diffusion, and energy landscapes in IRE all echo classical phenomena, just applied to a new entity (information). In doing so, IRE provides a possible bridge between dynamics and thermodynamics: where classical mechanics sees a collection of particles, IRE sees particles + an evolving information field that captures the system’s order. It’s a bit like moving from seeing just trees (particles) to also seeing the forest (the pattern formed by the collective).
IRE vs. Quantum Mechanics: Quantum physics is another realm where information has proven to be crucial. Phrases like “quantum information” and “entanglement” come to mind. In quantum theory, the state of a system (described by a wavefunction or a quantum state vector) encodes the probabilities of various outcomes – in essence, it’s an encapsulation of information about the system. A striking feature of quantum mechanics is that information is preserved in isolated systems (unitary evolution), and quantum entanglement shows that information can be non-local (two particles can share a single joint state such that measuring one instantly influences what we know about the other, no matter the distance). How does IRE relate to this? On one hand, IRE is not a quantum theory per se – it doesn’t require quantum weirdness to operate; it could be viewed as a “higher-level” principle that might emerge even in classical contexts. On the other hand, IRE’s emphasis on coherence resonates (pun intended) with quantum ideas. In quantum mechanics, coherence often refers to phase relationships in a wavefunction (when a system is in a coherent superposition, it can exhibit interference effects). In IRE, coherence is about structured information. These ideas might connect if one speculates that the informational coherence field of IRE is in some way related to quantum coherence when applied to quantum systems. For instance, consider a laser again: a laser is coherent light achieved by stimulated emission – effectively a quantum process where many photons occupy the same state (a high degree of quantum coherence and classical coherence in the beam). One could say the laser’s light has high informational coherence (it carries a very ordered phase information across space). In that case, the IRE field concept overlaps with the classical description of the laser’s electromagnetic field. But imagine a more exotic scenario: perhaps entangled particles share an informational coherence field such that a pattern spans them non-locally. Indeed, IRE explicitly allows for nonlocal interactions in the information field – meaning the field at one point can be influenced by the field at a distant point without immediate local mediation​
file-yxpvw1uluawnerq4wcfztc
​file-yxpvw1uluawnerq4wcfztc. This mirrors how entangled particles behave as if linked by something instantaneous (though quantum mechanics forbids sending usable signals faster than light, the correlations exist). IRE’s nonlocal term is not necessarily the same mechanism as quantum entanglement, but it suggests that global correlations are fundamental, which is very much a quantum mindset.
Another point of contact is the notion of observation and information in quantum theory. Wheeler’s “it from bit” was partly inspired by the quantum fact that an observer’s yes/no question (did the detector click?) seemingly brings reality into being. In other words, quantum events are information events. The IRE principle is congenial to this idea: it would hold that whenever a quantum event establishes a fact (information), that information becomes part of the real, evolving information field of the world and can affect other things. For example, if a bunch of atoms collapse into a particular state because we measured them, that newly created order (information that they are all in that state) might then influence surrounding fields (maybe releasing a bit of heat – Landauer’s principle again, tying back to thermodynamics). IRE could be seen as providing a narrative where quantum measurement (creating definite information) injects a spike of coherence into the information field which then propagates or diffuses.
Quantum computing provides another perspective: it uses coherent quantum information (qubits in superposition and entangled) to perform computations. The advantage of quantum computers comes precisely from maintaining coherence – if they decohere (lose coherent info), they just behave like classical ones. This exemplifies that information coherence has efficacy: when it’s present, you can do qualitatively new things (factor large numbers exponentially faster, etc.), when it’s absent, you cannot. IRE would nod and say, yes, coherent information is powerful – it’s practically a resource or “fuel” for processes (just like free energy is fuel for engines). In fact, physicists often talk about entanglement as a resource in quantum information theory. This is perfectly in line with IRE’s philosophy that information is a physical resource. The difference is that IRE would extend that concept beyond the quantum domain, saying that even in classical complex systems, structured information (like alignment of spins in magnet, or synchronized flashing of fireflies) is a resource that can drive processes.
Where IRE might challenge quantum mechanics is in the idea of state reduction or information loss. Quantum mechanics says information in a closed system is never lost (Hawking’s black hole information paradox debates revolve around this). IRE, by incorporating dissipation and possibly decoherence, acknowledges that from a local perspective, information coherence can diminish (like when a pattern disperses or randomizes). But globally, if one accounts for where the entropy went, information is conserved in the big picture. This again parallels quantum: decoherence (loss of local quantum info) is really just entangling with an environment (info goes somewhere). IRE’s field could be thought of as encompassing system + environment such that overall coherence might be tracked.
In sum, relative to quantum mechanics, IRE is not a competitor but rather a philosophical complement. It says: beyond the micro-level quantum coherence, there may be macro-level coherence principles at work. It extends the idea of an information-centric description to systems that classical physics usually handles, injecting a bit of “quantum-style thinking” (like nonlocality and importance of coherence) into classical contexts. It also provides a common language: we could talk about informational fields in a quantum context or a classical one, bridging the two. For example, an entangled pair of particles could be described by an informational coherence field that spans them both, just as two synchronized pendulums might be. The difference is scale and mechanism, but conceptually IRE provides a unified way to discuss “connectedness” and “patterned correlations” whether in quantum waves or classical waves.
IRE vs. Thermodynamics (and Information Theory): Thermodynamics, especially the second law, is often seen as the enemy of order – it predicts that isolated systems approach maximum entropy (complete disorder). Yet, we constantly observe local decreases in entropy: life builds order, planets and stars form out of clouds, etc. Thermodynamics itself doesn’t forbid local order, as long as greater disorder is produced elsewhere, but it doesn’t give us a straightforward law for how organized structures emerge. This is where the concept of information historically made an entrance: statistical mechanics (the microscopic foundation of thermodynamics) interprets entropy as missing information about microstates. In the mid-20th century, scientists like Léon Brillouin and Dennis Gabor began to explicitly talk about negentropy (negative entropy) as information, and Maxwell’s demon thought experiment forced physics to reckon with the role of information in thermodynamics. The resolution to Maxwell’s demon – which seemingly could create order (separate hot and cold gas) without expending energy – was that the demon’s acquisition and erasure of information has a thermodynamic cost, thus saving the second law​

. In other words, information has entropy, and you can’t increase order somewhere without paying in entropy when you process information.
IRE fully embraces this intimate link between information and entropy. It effectively builds a framework where the flow of information (the coherence field) and the flow of entropy (disorder, often tied to heat dissipation) are dual aspects of a single process. When we discussed an entropy-driven potential that encourages self-organization, that was essentially saying that the IRE field embodies the principle of minimizing free energy or entropy production locally​
file-yxpvw1uluawnerq4wcfztc
. In practical terms, a system can lower its entropy (raise its information coherence) if it can shed waste heat or entropy to the environment – this is how a refrigerator or a living cell works. IRE’s novelty is to say: let’s explicitly track the information gain as a field and see it as a driver of the process.
In classical thermodynamics, one might say “this chemical reaction happens because it releases energy and increases entropy of the surroundings.” In IRE, one might add “and in doing so, it increases the informational coherence of the system’s outcome – for instance, producing a more organized chemical structure – which is reflected as a buildup in the $\psi$ field.” Thus, IRE doesn’t contradict thermodynamics; it complements it by providing a bookkeeping of information coherence alongside the bookkeeping of energy and entropy. In fact, it provides a sort of unification of the first and second laws of thermodynamics with an information perspective: energy conservation (first law) and entropy increase (second law) together imply that any local decrease in entropy (more information) must be powered by energy flows. IRE explicitly includes terms for both energy (in the wave and kinetic aspects) and entropy (in the potential that favors order) in its formulation. It essentially encodes a balance – information coherence can grow (order forms) if energy is available and entropy is exported (dissipation term takes care of that).
Moreover, IRE ties into information theory (the mathematical theory founded by Claude Shannon) by acknowledging that information can be quantified. Shannon’s work told us how to measure information (in bits, via entropy formulas) and showed that information has surprising properties like trade-offs between entropy and knowledge. In information theory, a highly coherent message (like a repeated signal) has low entropy (because it’s predictable) whereas a completely random message has high entropy. The informational coherence field is basically mapping onto that concept: high $\psi$ means low entropy (locally) – a lot of predictability or structure. Thus one could say $\psi$ is a kind of negative entropy density (negentropy) in the system. IRE’s principle then is deeply connected to the idea of Maxwell’s Demon accounting: if $\psi$ increases somewhere, entropy (randomness) must be shuffled out or offset by energy expenditure. The IRE field equation includes dissipation to account for that, ensuring no violation of overall entropy law. In effect, IRE provides a candidate for a unified law that describes how systems can ride the line between increasing and decreasing entropy to produce complex order.
Another existing paradigm in thermodynamics and information is the concept of information engines – devices that convert information into work (like the Szilard engine, a one-molecule heat engine that uses information about the molecule’s position to extract work). Experiments in the last decade have actually realized such thought experiments, showing that indeed one can quantitatively trade information for energy in accordance with Landauer’s principle​
bigthink.com
. These developments underscore that information is a physical commodity. IRE would say: given information can be treated like energy in those engines, why not generalize that notion to all systems? Perhaps every organized structure is, in a sense, an “information engine” – it uses energy flows to maintain an information pattern (its structure). A hurricane, for example, takes thermal gradients (energy) and forms a coherent vortex (information structure). From IRE’s eyes, the hurricane is not just a fluid dynamic phenomenon, but also an information phenomenon: a huge reduction of entropy locally (air organized into a vortex) enabled by releasing heat and friction (entropy) into the environment.
Where IRE modifies the perspective of thermodynamics is by providing a more fine-grained and pattern-centric view. Thermodynamics is very bulk and statistical – it doesn’t care about the specific pattern, only the overall entropy, temperature, etc. IRE cares about the specific pattern (the coherence field describes which structure, not just how much entropy). In that sense, IRE connects thermodynamics to symmetry-breaking and pattern formation. Traditional thermodynamics might tell us if a phase transition is possible but not what pattern you’ll get (say, crystalline lattice structure isn’t determined by thermodynamics alone but by molecular details). IRE would incorporate those details into the information field’s potential, thereby being able to “select” a pattern. This is reminiscent of the Ginzburg-Landau theory in physics where a field (order parameter) describes phases and patterns beyond just entropy considerations, but IRE generalizes it to informational order parameters.
Finally, consider how IRE can unify concepts across disciplines. Classical mechanics gave us local dynamics, quantum mechanics gave us the importance of information (state functions) and nonlocal correlation, thermodynamics gave us the interplay of order/disorder and energy. IRE wraps elements of all three into one framework: it has a field like in classical theory (dynamics), it values information like quantum theory (though in a more macro way), and it explicitly incorporates entropy and order like thermodynamics. In doing so, it hints at a more comprehensive understanding of complexity. For example, the reaction-diffusion models that Alan Turing introduced in 1952 to explain how biological patterns (spots, stripes) arise, combined chemical kinetics (dynamics) with diffusion (a kind of spreading akin to entropy increase) to get emergent order​
file-yxpvw1uluawnerq4wcfztc
. IRE’s field is very much in that spirit – it is effectively a reaction-diffusion-wave equation for information itself. Thus, one can see IRE as a direct intellectual descendant of attempts to unify how patterns emerge in nature (Turing’s work, Prigogine’s work, etc.) but elevating the discussion to talk of information explicitly.
To put it succinctly, contrasting IRE with existing paradigms: where classical mechanics asks “What are the forces on the particles?”, IRE asks “What is the information structure and how does it evolve relative to the particles?”. Where quantum mechanics says “physical systems follow laws of wavefunctions and observables, preserving information in isolation”, IRE says “yes, and even at larger scales, something akin to a wavefunction of coherence (though classical in nature) might guide systems”. Where thermodynamics warns “order can form only at the expense of greater disorder elsewhere”, IRE cheerfully agrees but adds “we can track that order with an information field and even predict what form it will take.” In doing so, IRE doesn’t so much overthrow these pillars of science as augment and interconnect them. It stands on their shoulders to propose a more holistic principle: that information, matter, and energy are co-equal players in the cosmic drama, each converting into and influencing the others in lawful ways. This hearkens back to the idea of a unity of knowledge – bridging physics with information science – fulfilling to some extent Wheeler’s vision of a world where bit (information) and it (physical reality) are two sides of the same coin​

Illustrating IRE in Action
All of these abstract principles can be made more intuitive with some thought experiments and real-world examples. We will explore a few scenarios that demonstrate how the IRE principle might manifest, helping to build an intuitive grasp of what it means for information coherence to drive physical evolution. We will also introduce conceptual equations in a gentle way to solidify the ideas, without getting lost in mathematical formalism.
1. The Lake of Patterns (Thought Experiment): Imagine a shallow lake on a calm day. Now imagine dropping not just one pebble, but many pebbles in a deliberate arrangement – say, a ring of pebbles all at once. Each pebble generates ripples, and these ripples begin to interfere with each other. If dropped randomly, the waves would create a messy superposition and soon dissipate into a kind of rough, irregular surface. But if dropped in a carefully coordinated way (say all pebbles equidistant in a circle, dropped simultaneously), the waves might converge and amplify at the center, creating a large, focused upwelling of water at that spot – a pattern. This is a loose analogy for information coherence shaping an outcome. The pebbles drops carry information (the positions where they were dropped and timing). When random (incoherent information input), the result is ephemeral and disordered. When coherent (patterned input), the result is an emergent structure (the big ripple in the middle). Now, consider that in an IRE view, the lake’s surface has an information coherence field describing the wave pattern. Initially (before drops) it’s uniform (no info). When we drop pebbles with a pattern, we essentially imprint an initial condition on the info field that is coherent (a symmetric ring). The subsequent evolution (the ripples) carries that information inward (wave propagation) and through constructive interference (resonance), produces a notable feature at the center. The dissipation in water eventually calms it, but for a time the lake’s surface “remembers” the pattern of drops through the coherent wave it created. In IRE terms, we could say the information field facilitated the self-focusing of energy into a pattern. This simple image helps us see that when inputs are coherent, the system responds in an organized way.
2. Turing’s Chemical Patterns: Alan Turing’s famous thought experiment for morphogenesis (how animals get their spots and stripes) can serve as a concrete example of IRE-like behavior in chemistry. Turing proposed a model with two chemicals that react and diffuse, where one chemical activates a reaction and the other inhibits it. If set up right, this system will spontaneously form stable patterns (like spots or stripes) instead of just blending into uniformity​
file-yxpvw1uluawnerq4wcfztc
. This happens because a random fluctuation that produces a bit more of activator in one spot leads to a self-reinforcing cycle (activator spurs more of itself locally – resonance, inhibitor diffuses out more – nonlinear diffusion and local antagonism), and eventually a leopard gets its spots. In an IRE interpretation, we could talk about an information coherence field of chemical concentration patterns. Initially, the field is nearly zero (homogeneous chemical, no information except noise). A small random bit of information (a slight concentration difference) appears. The system’s rules are such that this difference is amplified (feedback) at certain length scales (only spots of a certain size form – that’s resonance selecting a wavelength), and diffusion makes sure the pattern is evenly spaced (spreading the information but in a way constrained by the reaction). Soon, a clear pattern (high information coherence – knowing the pattern in one area lets you predict it in others) emerges from randomness. This is a textbook example of order from chaos. We can illustrate it with a conceptual equation reminiscent of what Turing wrote, but abstracted for IRE:
latex
Copy
$$ \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 \psi + f(\psi) + \eta. $$


Here $\psi(x,t)$ could represent the information coherence field (or even just the concentration difference in Turing’s model, which is a kind of info). The term $D\nabla^2 \psi$ is a diffusion term (with $D$ possibly depending on $\psi$, making it nonlinear diffusion). The term $f(\psi)$ represents the local reactions or feedback – in IRE, this would come from the potential that favors certain $\psi$ values (for instance, $f(\psi)$ could be derived from $-dV/d\psi$ in a Lagrangian formulation, encouraging $\psi$ to be either high or low, creating domains). The $\eta$ might represent noise (random fluctuations). Turing showed that for certain $f(\psi)$ (an activator-inhibitor interplay), a uniform state $\psi=$ constant can become unstable and the equation drives the system to a new patterned state. That’s exactly what IRE encapsulates generally: uniform disorder can be unstable if there’s a mechanism (information feedback) to create order, and the system will then spontaneously evolve into a structured pattern.
The key intuitive takeaway from the Turing pattern example is that local interactions + information diffusion can yield global coherence. The IRE principle generalizes this notion beyond just chemical concentrations: any system with components that affect each other and some ability to spread or communicate can potentially generate coherence from noise. The informational coherence field in IRE is like a master variable that summarizes all those interacting components into one evolving pattern.
3. Synchronizing Fireflies (Real-world example): In some regions of the world, large groups of fireflies synchronize their flashing lights at night. Initially, each firefly might flash at its own rhythm, but as they observe each other (seeing flashes is exchanging information), they adjust their timing and eventually thousands of insects blink in unison, creating waves of light. This is a biological example of an emergent coherence field. Each firefly is like an oscillator that can be slightly sped up or slowed down based on signals from neighbors. The collective flashing pattern can be seen as a field of phase (or timing) coherence spread across the swarm. When fully synchronized, the information coherence is high: if you see one firefly flash, you can predict all the others will flash almost at the same time – they are correlated. If they were independent, knowing one tells you nothing about others (low coherence). The classical way to analyze this is with coupled oscillators and perhaps the Kuramoto model (a mathematical model for synchronization). The IRE way to describe it is to say: there is an informational coherence field representing the phase alignment of fireflies. Through interaction (fireflies watching each other – exchanging bits of timing info) and a bit of diffusion (one flash influences neighbors, which influence their neighbors, etc.), the field evolves from incoherence (random phases) to coherence (aligned phases). Resonance is at play too: if one pattern of flashing (say all in sync with a certain period) is a resonant mode of the system, it will amplify because each firefly reinforcing the common rhythm is like constructive interference. Eventually, the system “locks in” to a shared rhythm (a stable attractor). Here, no single firefly is the leader – it’s a self-organized coherence. The information that becomes coherent is “when to flash.” This example shows how information (timing) becomes an ordering principle across many individuals.
We can draw a parallel conceptual equation for synchronization: if $\theta_i$ is the phase of firefly $i$, a simple model is
dθidt=ω+K∑j neighborssin⁡(θj−θi),\frac{d\theta_i}{dt} = \omega + K \sum_{j \text{ neighbors}} \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i),dtdθi​​=ω+K∑j neighbors​sin(θj​−θi​),
where $\omega$ is its natural frequency and $K$ is a coupling strength. This leads to synchronization for large $K$. But in an IRE field description, instead of tracking each $\theta_i$, we could have a continuous field $\phi(x,t)$ representing the local phase. The evolution might then be
∂tϕ=Ω+D∇2ϕ+nonlinear terms to encourage phase locking.\partial_t \phi = \Omega + D \nabla^2 \phi + \text{nonlinear terms to encourage phase locking}.∂t​ϕ=Ω+D∇2ϕ+nonlinear terms to encourage phase locking.
When stable synchronization is reached, $\nabla \phi \approx 0$ (phase is almost same everywhere) – a high coherence state. The details aren’t crucial; the point is that an information (phase of oscillation) is being communicated and unified by an effective field.
4. Life’s Emergence (Thought experiment): Let’s venture into a speculative example: the origin of life. One of the great questions is how a random soup of chemicals became an organized, self-replicating system – essentially how information (genetic information, metabolic networks) crystallized out of randomness. There are many theories (metabolism-first, RNA world, etc.), but consider it from IRE perspective. Early Earth had energy flows (sunlight, volcanic heat) driving chemical reactions – lots of opportunities for local order (molecules forming). Most such structures would be transient. Now, imagine an “information coherence field” for chemical reaction networks. Perhaps at first it’s near zero – chemicals form and break apart randomly (no sustained patterns). But once in a while, a small autocatalytic cycle forms: a set of molecules that help create each other. That’s a little pattern of information (like a little circuit of reactions). If that happens, suddenly we have a local increase in coherence (because the presence of certain molecules predicts the production of others – an organized causal loop exists). If the environment supports it (enough energy, raw materials), this little info-pattern can grow, recruiting more molecules into its cycle (like spreading the pattern – diffusion of the idea of self-replication). It might also crowd out resources, inhibiting other patterns (competition). Over time, perhaps one such autocatalytic information structure dominates a region – akin to the first protocell or replicator. In IRE terms, the information coherence field has transitioned from near-zero (no autocatalytic order) to some positive value concentrated where the cycle runs. That coherence then physically manifests as a localized chemical order (a primitive “cell”). This cell might grow and split (akin to replication), further spreading the pattern (so the info field now has multiple hotspots). This is a narrative way to see the emergence of life as an informational phase transition – where chemical information (who reacts with whom) became coherent and started driving its own continuation.
While highly speculative, if one were to write an equation for this, it could look like a reaction-diffusion system with nonlinearity to represent autocatalysis. For example, if $\psi$ represented the concentration of an autocatalytic substance (or a set of them), we could have
∂tψ=D∇2ψ+aψ2−bψ+…,\partial_t \psi = D \nabla^2 \psi + a \psi^2 - b \psi + \ldots,∂t​ψ=D∇2ψ+aψ2−bψ+…,
where $a \psi^2$ might represent autocatalytic growth (needs two molecules to meet to produce a new one, hence $\psi^2$), and $-b\psi$ some decay or resource limitation. If $a$ is above a threshold, $\psi=0$ (no life) becomes unstable, and a new state $\psi >0$ (some concentration) becomes stable – meaning spontaneously molecules start sustaining a positive concentration rather than decaying away. That’s a toy model of something from nothing. In terms of information, $\psi>0$ state carries more information (the presence of molecules and their mutual relationships is an organized fact, compared to randomness of $\psi=0$ where any molecule is immediately gone).
5. Social and Computational Patterns (Analogy): Consider a modern example: the emergence of a consensus or a viral trend on social media. Initially, opinions or memes are scattered (noise). Through sharing and algorithmic amplification (which is essentially feedback and selective resonance for certain messages), you can get a global trend – many people aligning on the same piece of information or sentiment. The “field” here is the distribution of that meme or opinion in the network of people. As it becomes coherent (many people holding the same information), it gains power – it can influence elections, markets, etc., i.e., it affects reality. While this drifts from physics, it’s an intuitive case of information coherence having a causal impact (widespread belief or knowledge leading to coordinated action). It’s also a cautionary tale: just as resonance can amplify a mode, a society can amplify certain narratives to great effect, for better or worse. That’s why sometimes we speak of the “information landscape” or “info echo chambers” – it’s as if there is a field of information that can be in a certain state and affect a whole population.
From these examples, the pattern is clear: whenever there is a possibility for parts of a system to influence each other and share information, an informational coherence field can emerge, guiding the system into patterns. Sometimes, these patterns are transient (like ripples on a lake), sometimes they’re steady (like synchronized fireflies or chemical patterns), and sometimes they self-replicate (like life or memes). In each case, if we apply the language of IRE, we’d describe it as the information field $\psi(x,t)$ starting from noise (random fluctuations), then certain modes growing (the ones that resonate with the system’s rules), information spreading (so that distant parts aren’t independent anymore), and eventually a macro-scale order forming (high coherence across the system). Then dissipation or external changes might break it down again (decoherence), unless maintained by continued input (like fireflies keep seeing each other, or energy keeps pumping into the chemical reaction).
One more conceptual equation to illustrate key IRE ideas in a unified way: the canonical IRE field equation derived in the theory has the form of a nonlinear wave equation with damping and potential:
∂2ψ∂t2+γ∂ψ∂t⏟dissipation−c2∇2ψ⏟wave propagation+δF[ψ]δψ⏟potential/feedback=0⏟(no external forcing).\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial t^2} + \underbrace{\gamma \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}}_{\text{dissipation}} - \underbrace{c^2 \nabla^2 \psi}_{\text{wave propagation}} + \underbrace{\frac{\delta F[\psi]}{\delta \psi}}_{\text{potential/feedback}} = \underbrace{0}_{\text{(no external forcing)}}.∂t2∂2ψ​+dissipationγ∂t∂ψ​​​−wave propagationc2∇2ψ​​+potential/feedbackδψδF[ψ]​​​=(no external forcing)0​​.
Let’s unpack this without formality: here $\psi$ is the information coherence field. The term with $c^2 \nabla^2 \psi$ is like a wave term (implying info disturbances move at speed $c$). The term $\gamma \partial \psi/\partial t$ is a damping term (with $\gamma$ controlling strength of dissipation). The term $\delta F/\delta \psi$ is the functional derivative of some free-energy-like functional $F[\psi]$; it acts like the derivative of a potential energy, generating forces that push $\psi$ toward minima of $F$. This is where the self-organization and nonlinear feedback come in – by properly choosing $F[\psi]$ one can encode the tendency to form patterns (for example, $F$ could include terms like $-\frac{\alpha}{2}\psi^2 + \frac{\beta}{4}\psi^4$ which gives a double-well potential favoring either high or low $\psi$ states, leading to domain formation, similar to models of phase separation or binary decision spreads). Nonlocal interactions can be included by making $F$ have integrals of $\psi(x)\psi(y)$ kernels, etc., meaning $\delta F/\delta \psi$ could include nonlocal terms – that’s how distant parts of the field might directly couple.
This equation is a bit heavy, but conceptually it says: the oscillatory (wave) nature allows communication, the potential drives pattern selection and growth, and dissipation ensures stability. In a simpler scenario where inertia is negligible (for slow dynamics), the $\partial^2/\partial t^2$ might be small and one recovers something like a Ginzburg-Landau or reaction-diffusion type equation: $\partial \psi/\partial t = c^2 \nabla^2 \psi - \delta F/\delta \psi - \ldots$ (where now the potential’s derivative appears with opposite sign on the right, acting like $f(\psi)$ earlier). These are just different regimes of the IRE framework (wave-dominated vs diffusion-dominated).
What matters for our intuitive discussion is: if you were to simulate such an equation on a computer, starting from random initial $\psi$ values, you would see it spontaneously create patches or waves of coherent structure. For instance, depending on parameters, you might see something like spiral wave patterns (common in some reaction-diffusion systems and observed in chemical reactions like Belousov-Zhabotinsky), or stripe domains, or pulsating solitons. These visual patterns would be the manifestation of the information field organizing itself. In a very real sense, it’s like watching “information” become a thing you can see – because the field $\psi$ could correspond to something physical like a refractive index variation, or a density variation, etc., which we can observe.
These illustrations reinforce that IRE is not mere abstraction. Its consequences appear in many analogues around us. By reframing those phenomena in terms of an information coherence field, we gain a potentially more unified understanding. Instead of saying “well, synchronization is a thing in biology, pattern formation is a thing in chemistry, self-organization is a thing in physics, and network effects are a thing in sociology,” IRE says all these are the same kind of thing at some level: the emergence of coherent information structure out of interacting parts. That is a powerful unifying insight.
Implications and Applications
The IRE principle, if taken as a fundamental perspective, has far-reaching implications across many fields of inquiry. It essentially provides a common language to talk about order, complexity, and information in systems as diverse as brains, computers, living organisms, and galaxies. Let’s explore a few domains and how IRE could apply, bringing new insights or connecting existing ones:
Consciousness and Cognition
One of the most intriguing applications of IRE is to the realm of mind and consciousness. The human brain is often described as the most complex system we know of – billions of neurons constantly exchanging signals (information). Neuroscientists have long noticed that brain activity isn’t just random; it’s highly organized across multiple scales. We have brain waves (synchronized oscillations of large groups of neurons at specific frequencies like alpha ~10 Hz or gamma ~40 Hz), we have functional networks that activate together during certain tasks, and we have the puzzling unity of subjective experience (we perceive a coherent scene, not disjoint bits). Integrated Information Theory (IIT), a modern theory of consciousness, posits that consciousness corresponds to how much information is integrated into a unified whole in a system​
psychologytoday.com
. In other words, the degree of informational coherence (integration) might directly relate to the level of conscious awareness. This is a natural arena for IRE-like thinking: one could conjecture that the brain’s informational coherence field is literally what we experience as consciousness – that consciousness is the state of the information coherence field in the brain, physically real and dynamic.
Even if one doesn’t go so far, IRE can still illuminate cognition. For instance, consider how the brain solves a problem or recognizes a face. Various neurons processing different features eventually lead to a single unified recognition (“Aha, it’s my friend’s face!”). In IRE terms, one could view this as initially disparate pieces of information (edges, colors, shapes detected in different visual areas) becoming coherent – snapping together into a pattern that represents the known face. The informational coherence field would start in a diffuse state (different bits of info in different places) and end in a focused state (a coalition of neurons representing the face concept, all firing in a coordinated way). That corresponds to the moment of recognition, where the system attains a higher $\psi$ (coherence) by linking the pieces into a whole. This process may even be physically analogous to a phase transition in the brain’s neural network – sometimes described as neurons “settling” into an attractor state. With IRE, we can explicitly talk about an attractor in the information field.
Furthermore, applying IRE to brains suggests why certain brain rhythms or structures are so important. For example, if consciousness requires a high degree of integrated information, then conditions that disrupt coherence (like anesthesia or deep sleep) correspond to lowering the $\psi$ field (the brain’s info field becomes fragmented or oscillatory in an uncoordinated way). Conversely, when someone is highly alert and conscious, various parts of the brain resonate together (certain frequencies dominate EEG), indicating a strong coherence field spanning many regions. This also resonates with clinical observations: disorders like epilepsy show hyper-synchronization (too much coherence in a pathological way), whereas disorders of consciousness might show too little integration. IRE provides a quantitative language to speak about this: one could imagine measuring an “IRE field strength” in the brain and correlating it with consciousness level.
One more tantalizing thought: If consciousness is indeed linked to integrated information (as IIT claims and IRE would concur), then treating the information coherence as physically real might help resolve the so-called “hard problem” of consciousness (why and how physical processes produce subjective experience). IRE might suggest that subjective experience just is what it feels like for information to be coherent and self-processing. That drifts into philosophy, but it shows IRE’s potential to not only unify sciences but also to offer a new ontology for mind: that the mind is a field of structured information doing work on itself. Experiments in neuroscience could potentially test this by attempting to manipulate the informational coherence field (for example, using techniques like transcranial magnetic stimulation to impose certain synchrony patterns) and seeing if that induces predictable changes in perception or awareness.
Computation and Artificial Intelligence
Computation at its core is information processing, and today’s computers are physical devices that shuffle bits. Usually, we design computers in a very controlled way: sequences of logic gates, clock signals, etc., to ensure reliable, deterministic behavior. However, with the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially in artificial neural networks, we see emergent information coherence in action. A neural network (whether biological or artificial) starts with distributed activity that gradually changes as it learns, eventually forming stable patterns that represent knowledge or skills. In a trained AI system, certain concepts are encoded in the weights and activations – in effect, the network has informational structures (like neurons in a certain layer firing together to indicate a feature). From an IRE viewpoint, we could say the training process is driving the system to a higher informational coherence state regarding the tasks it’s learning. The network’s “knowledge” is essentially a set of patterns of activation (information) that reliably arise and influence the network’s outputs.
In the context of AI, IRE might lead to new algorithms that explicitly maximize informational coherence. Traditional training already does something similar by reducing error (which increases order in outputs), but one could imagine an AI that has a built-in objective to increase the integration of information across its layers (maybe leading to more human-like learning, as humans often learn by connecting pieces of knowledge into a coherent understanding). There is also an intersection with quantum computing: if IRE is onto something about info coherence as a resource, quantum computing is already an existence proof that more coherence can mean more computational power (because quantum algorithms leverage coherent superposition and entanglement to do parallel computations). Perhaps classical systems, too, can benefit from states of high information coherence. We see hints of this in analog computing or neuromorphic computing, where instead of strictly segregating memory and processing, systems blend them and let patterns emerge (much like the brain).
Another application: optimization and search problems. Many hard computational problems (like the famous traveling salesman problem) involve searching for an ordered structure among many possibilities. It’s akin to finding a low energy state in a physical system. Physicists have even used simulated annealing (a process inspired by thermodynamics) to solve such problems by gradually lowering “temperature” (randomness) to coax the system into an ordered solution. IRE could provide a theoretical backing for why that works: as randomness (entropy) is reduced, the information coherence field of the candidate solution landscape increases, revealing structured solutions. Taking it further, one could design algorithms that treat the solution space as having an information field and intentionally create feedback to amplify partial good solutions. For example, in evolutionary algorithms (where many candidate solutions evolve over generations), one could introduce a mechanism where promising partial patterns are broadcast and recombined – effectively diffusing informational coherence among candidates. This could accelerate finding a global solution by not reinventing the wheel in each candidate but sharing the “good information” (coherent building blocks). In a way, this is what crossover in genetic algorithms already does, but perhaps IRE can optimize such processes by thinking in terms of fields rather than pairwise exchanges.
In more concrete technology terms, if information coherence is physical, could we build a new kind of computer that directly harnesses an IRE field? Consider a reconfigurable material that adapts its conductivity based on patterns of current (learning hardware). As it processes input signals, it might literally form standing wave patterns of electrical activity (like oscillating circuits synchronizing) to represent solutions. Some experimental computing devices like optical processors or quantum annealers already operate in a domain where waves of probability or light interfere to yield results – which is basically using coherence for computation. IRE might inspire more of these, perhaps hybrid classical ones using resonance and oscillation. It also reminds us that computation need not be sequential or digital; it can be holistic and analog, exploiting the physics of coherence. For AI, maybe this points toward new architectures that are more self-organizing (beyond static network layers, something like an “info field” that the AI’s components interact through – an interesting idea in distributed computing or multi-agent systems where the agent’s coordination is via a shared info field like a blackboard system but more dynamic).
Finally, the notion of information as having mass or energy equivalence (like Dr. Vopson’s hypothesis of mass-energy-information equivalence​
bigthink.com
​
bigthink.com
) could lead to physical computing limits or possibilities. If information has a tiny effective mass, extremely dense information processing might have subtle gravitational effects or energy requirements beyond heat dissipation. While speculative, exploring IRE might force engineers to consider not just heat (entropy) but also how highly coherent information states might cause unforeseen couplings in hardware (perhaps in the future, as circuits get even more extreme).
Biology and Evolutionary Processes
We already touched on the origin of life scenario, but IRE has broad implications for biology at all levels. Biology is fundamentally about information: DNA encodes it, organisms process it, ecosystems exchange it. The IRE viewpoint could provide a unifying principle for several biological phenomena:
   * Genetic Information and Morphogenesis: DNA can be seen as a repository of instructions (information) for building an organism. But how is that information realized in space and time to create a coherent organism? Developmental biology involves gradients of morphogens, gene regulatory networks turning on/off in sync, cells communicating, etc. This is ripe for an informational coherence interpretation. One might envision an informational field in an embryo that starts with a simple pattern (maybe maternal morphogen gradients – a form of info pre-pattern) and then, through cell interactions, refines into complex structures (limbs, organs – each of which is a domain of high internal coherence: e.g., all cells in an organ have a shared identity and structure). Errors in this process (like genetic mutations causing chaotic signaling) lead to birth defects – basically when the information field fails to cohere properly. If biologists adopted IRE language, they might be encouraged to find ways to measure coherence in developing tissue (perhaps using imaging that captures how correlated the gene expression patterns are across space). They might find that just before a tissue differentiates into, say, an organ, there’s a surge in coherence in gene expression – analogous to a phase transition where a bunch of cells suddenly get on the same page about what to become. Indeed, phenomena like somite formation (the rhythmic segmentation in embryos that forms vertebrae) show a clock and wavefront model – essentially oscillating gene expression that sweeps through tissue to lay down segments. That is an information wave quite literally.
   * Physiology and Homeostasis: An adult organism maintains order (low entropy) through constant metabolism and control mechanisms. The nervous system and endocrine system broadcast signals that keep various parts functioning in a coordinated way. One could think of this as maintaining a body-wide coherence field: e.g., your body temperature is tightly regulated, which is like saying all cells have coherent information about the thermal state; or your circadian rhythm synchronizes clocks in different organs. IRE could suggest new ways to look at diseases: for example, cancer might be interpreted as a breakdown of informational coherence between cells – they no longer follow the organism’s overall regulatory patterns and instead follow more primitive individual rules. If one could “re-cohere” them (get cancer cells to re-synchronize with the normal signaling fields of the body), perhaps that’s a way to treat it. Some experimental cancer therapies try to target the signaling environment to normalize it. It’s essentially an informational approach: fix the corrupted messages rather than just kill the cells.
   * Ecology and Evolution: On larger scales, species in an ecosystem exchange information (through signals, population dynamics, etc.), potentially leading to coherent cycles (like predator-prey oscillations). The biosphere as a whole has been hypothesized to behave like a self-regulating system (Gaia hypothesis) – which one could frame as an informational coherence across life forms maintaining certain homeostatic conditions (like global temperatures, oxygen levels). Evolution is often described as the evolution of information – genes mutating and selecting. Over time, the genetic information in a population becomes more adapted (more coherent with respect to the environment’s demands). We can even measure increases in complexity or information in the fossil record (though it’s not monotonic). IRE might offer a framework to quantify informational coherence of an ecosystem or gene pool. Perhaps one could define an $\psi$ that is high when species are well adapted and niches are well filled (everything is in balance, like pieces of a puzzle fitting – which is a coherent informational structure), whereas an unstable ecosystem (say after a mass extinction) has low coherence (lots of randomness in which species survive until a new order emerges). Evolution could then be seen as a process that, despite involving random mutations (which add entropy), is guided by selection which amplifies coherent information (useful traits) – a clear analogy to resonance and feedback in IRE. Selection feedback is essentially “this pattern of genes works well, so it gets reinforced in the next generation.” Over many generations, complexity can accumulate – analogous to how a repeated feedback can grow a pattern in the IRE field. The question of increasing complexity in evolution (why did life move from simple to complex organisms over billions of years) could be partly answered by IRE: as long as there’s energy (sunlight) and a way to export entropy (waste heat, dead biomass decaying), there’s a drive to higher coherence (more organized ecosystems) up to some limit. Life’s complexity might be the universe’s way of pumping out entropy by creating little pockets of highly organized information (like the global network of life) which are sustained by continuous energy flux.
One concrete application: bioinformatics and systems biology might use IRE to analyze cellular networks. Instead of just looking at static interaction maps, one could simulate an IRE field over a network to see how information flows and where it tends to concentrate or form stable patterns. It might highlight key regulatory nodes (points that, when coherent, drive the whole network to coherence – akin to pacemaker cells in the heart that set the rhythm for all heart cells). Indeed, the heart is another example: billions of cells in the heart muscle all beat in near unison because a group of pacemaker cells sends waves (electric signals) that coordinate them. That’s an information wave maintaining a vital coherence (arrhythmia = breakdown of coherence, leading to fibrillation which is essentially chaos). Techniques like defibrillation literally jolt the heart to erase errant patterns, hoping it will restart in a coherent rhythm. That is a dramatic real-world interplay of information (the phase of contraction) and life-or-death physical outcome.
Cosmology and Large-Scale Structure Formation
On the grandest scales, IRE might influence how we think about the cosmos itself. The universe began in a hot, fairly uniform state after the Big Bang, with tiny fluctuations (as seen in the cosmic microwave background). Over billions of years, those tiny fluctuations – essentially small bits of information (slightly higher density here, lower there) – have evolved into the vast cosmic web of galaxies and voids we observe. Gravity alone explains a lot of that: denser regions attract more matter, becoming even denser (a runaway, resonant kind of effect), which is a form of positive feedback, while sparse regions get emptier. This is analogous to pattern formation: gravity acted like the “activator” that amplified certain fluctuations. Now, if we overlay an IRE perspective: one could say the universe’s matter distribution has an informational coherence field too – initially almost uniform (low info), later clumpy (high info structure like filaments and clusters). Did the universe have to form a cosmic web? If one ran it again with same initial conditions, presumably yes, because gravity’s laws make it so – those laws are like the rules of the IRE field favoring structure formation (it’s essentially an entropy minimization: clumping releases gravitational potential energy as heat, increasing entropy overall, but creates local order in matter distribution).
Where IRE could provide new insight in cosmology is in questions like the arrow of time and entropy. The early universe paradoxically had low entropy despite being a hot plasma – low entropy in the sense of very uniform (which is high information if you think about it: specifying “all points have nearly the same density” is a simple rule, but specifying today’s lumpy universe is more complex information). Cosmologists like Roger Penrose have noted that the low entropy of the early universe (mostly in the gravitational degrees of freedom) is what allowed complex structures (galaxies, life) to eventually form – basically the universe started in a very special state. IRE might conceptualize this by saying the early universe had an informational coherence in that uniformity (or in whatever quantum seeds were laid down by inflation) that set the stage for more info coherence to emerge. It’s as if the universe began with a pre-tuned information field (maybe from inflation which created coherent quantum fluctuations across vast distances). Those fluctuations were coherent in that they had a certain spectrum (pattern of sizes) across space – indeed they did, nearly scale-invariant as measured. That coherence guided structure formation (certain sizes of structures form first, etc.).
Another cosmological puzzle is dark matter and dark energy – currently attributed to unknown substances/fields. There are radical suggestions like the one by Vopson (mentioned earlier) that maybe information itself has an effective mass and could contribute to things like dark matter​

. If information (especially coherent information) had gravitational effects, then one might wonder if large-scale coherent structures have a subtle extra gravity than we expect. This is far-fetched at current, but IRE would at least allow one to phrase the question: does an extremely well-organized system gravitate differently than a disordered one, all else equal? Normally, gravity cares only about mass-energy, not how it’s arranged. But if information has equivalence to energy in some way, a hypothesis could be tested. Vopson’s idea of mass-energy-information equivalence tries to quantify that​

. Even if that’s not the explanation for dark matter, the point remains that cosmology is dealing with information too: the information content of the whole universe, the entropy in black holes (Bekenstein bound, holographic principle linking area of black hole to information content on its surface). The holographic principle itself is basically telling us that the maximum information in a volume is proportional not to volume but to surface area – a profound interplay of geometry and information that might hint at something like an IRE field underlying spacetime itself.
In the speculative realm, some physicists have suggested space and time might be emergent from quantum information (entanglement patterns). If space is emergent from a network of information, then IRE is almost vindicated at the most fundamental level: it would mean the geometry we live in is a manifestation of an underlying information coherence (the fabric of spacetime being woven by the threads of entanglement connecting particles). This is a very active research area in quantum gravity (ER=EPR conjecture, tensor networks, etc.). While IRE as described here isn’t explicitly a theory of spacetime, its spirit aligns with these ideas: that you can’t separate the info from reality; the info literally becomes the structure of reality. In a universe where that is true, perhaps IRE would be the emergent classical principle of such a quantum informational cosmos – guiding how classical structures form out of that substrate.
Even more concretely, IRE might have applications in understanding complex astrophysical systems: for example, a galaxy can be thought of as a self-organizing system with stars, gas, etc., and certain patterns like spiral arms. Those arms are not just prettiness; they are density waves – coherent informational structures moving through the stars (stars move in and out, like cars in a traffic jam). It’s information (the pattern of higher density) that travels, more than any one star’s journey. IRE could model spiral arm formation as an information wave phenomenon akin to other pattern formations. Similarly, the way planets in a solar system align or how rings of Saturn show structures (like gaps due to shepherd moons – an exchange of information via gravity). In short, many patterns in the cosmos might be reframed as “the universe organizing information under various forces” – which doesn’t change the predictions necessarily, but it changes the way we conceptually link them. We start to see commonality between a chemical pattern on a Petri dish and a spiral galaxy: both could be viewed as resonance patterns of an underlying field equation that seeks structure (just with different physical interpretations of the field and forces).
Given these implications across fields, IRE has the potential to provide new answers or at least new ways of asking questions about longstanding puzzles. For example:
   * What is life’s defining property? IRE would say a high, self-sustaining informational coherence (DNA->organism).
   * What distinguishes a conscious brain from an unconscious one? Perhaps the level of integrated information (which IRE treats as physically real).
   * Why did the universe evolve complexity instead of just heat death everywhere? Because the initial conditions and ongoing energy flux allow information coherence pockets to grow (stars, galaxies, life) which are avenues for entropy increase (paradoxically order arises as a side effect of disordering the rest).
   * Can we unify physics and information? IRE is an attempt to do exactly that on a classical level, and hints how one might proceed toward a deeper theory where information is on equal footing with matter/energy, possibly leading into quantum gravity ideas.
Of course, adopting IRE widely would also raise new questions and require new research. It suggests experiments: e.g., measure the “information field” in a complex system (maybe define metrics of coherence and see if they obey wave-like propagation or diffusion laws). It also invites the development of new mathematics to handle nonlocal, nonlinear field equations that are information-based. It might even challenge us to refine what we mean by “information” in a physical sense: we’d need to carefully define the field $\psi$ for different systems (it might be some coarse-grained measure of mutual information among parts, or an order parameter in traditional terms).
Conclusion
The Information Relative Evolution principle offers a comprehensive new perspective on the role of information in the universe. Let’s recap the central insights:
   * IRE posits that information, specifically the coherence or organized structure of information, is a physical reality that actively participates in the evolution of systems. Rather than being a passive reflection of physical state, information (when organized) acts rather like a field or force, influencing how matter and energy arrange themselves over time. This is a fundamental shift in perspective, elevating information to the same ontological status as energy or momentum in our descriptions of nature.
   * We introduced the idea of an informational coherence field $\psi(x,t)$ that quantifies the degree of order or meaningful pattern at each point in space and time. This field captures the “shape” of information in a system – how information is distributed and correlated. A high value of $\psi$ indicates a lot of structure (low entropy, high order) locally, and the field as a whole can show patterns which correspond to the emergent structures we observe (like stripes, waves, clusters, synchrony, etc., in various contexts).
   * The IRE field evolves according to principles analogous to known physical processes: it supports wave-like propagation of information, it exhibits diffusion that spreads and smooths information (with nonlinear effects), it has an inherent tendency to form and maintain order (capturing self-organization, anti-entropy locally) balanced by dissipation (ensuring consistency with the second law and stability), and it allows feedback loops that amplify certain patterns (resonance and mode selection). In doing so, IRE unifies concepts from classical dynamics, thermodynamics, and information theory into one framework. We saw that the IRE field equation can be formulated from a variational principle, yielding a sort of hybrid of wave equations and diffusion equations with a potential term – a unification that is reminiscent of how different phenomena (sound, heat, chemical patterns, etc.) might all be special cases of one generalized dynamics.
   * Contrasting IRE with existing paradigms revealed that it doesn’t discard those paradigms but extends them. IRE carries forward the deterministic, causal structure of classical mechanics but with an extra ingredient (information as a causal agent). It resonates with quantum mechanics’ view of the primacy of information (quantum states, entanglement) but applies that lesson more broadly and classically. It respects thermodynamics (never suggesting free lunch decreases of total entropy) but provides a language for how local entropy can decrease (because information coherence rises, at the cost of entropy exported via dissipation). In a way, IRE acts as a synthesis: from classical physics it takes dynamics, from quantum it takes informational holism, from thermodynamics it takes entropy and irreversibility, and melds these into a single narrative about how complex structure comes to be.
   * Illustrative examples, from chemical patterns to synchronizing fireflies to possible origins of life, helped concretize what IRE means in practice. These examples emphasized that whenever components of a system share information and adapt to it, an information field is effectively in play. We saw analogies in equations that reminded us of real physical and biological systems, lending credence to the idea that IRE isn’t fanciful; it’s already operative in many systems, just not recognized as such. By framing these phenomena in terms of information coherence, we potentially gain deeper intuition and predictive power – we start looking for waves of information, order parameters that represent patterns, and feedback loops that drive organization in systems where previously we might not have thought to do so.
   * The implications of IRE span a wide array of fields:
   1. In consciousness studies, IRE aligns with theories that tie consciousness to integrated information, suggesting a new way to scientifically frame subjective experience as an emergent property of an informational field in the brain.
   2. In AI and computing, IRE points toward leveraging coherence and self-organization for more powerful computation or learning, and cautions us to consider information as a physical resource (with costs and perhaps untapped potentials).
   3. In biology, from cellular processes to evolution, IRE provides a framework to understand how life manages to stave off entropy and create intricate order – essentially by being an information processing engine that takes in energy and outputs entropy, using the negentropy gained to build structure. It encourages looking at ecological and evolutionary dynamics as the flow and development of information across generations and environments.
   4. In cosmology, IRE fits into our understanding of structure formation and cosmic evolution by treating gravitational clustering, etc., as not just mechanical processes but as information increasing processes (the universe writing information into its structure over time). It even hints at connections to cutting-edge ideas where spacetime and gravity themselves may be emergent from information (holography, etc.), thus potentially serving as a bridge between modern physics and information-centric views of reality.
   * Adopting the IRE perspective could be transformative. It would mean that scientists and philosophers start thinking of patterns and information flows with the same seriousness as they think of particles and forces. It could lead to new laws or principles, like conservation laws involving information coherence, or variational principles where a quantity (perhaps “action of information”) is extremized. It might also unify descriptive and dynamical sciences: currently, disciplines like information theory or computer science are somewhat distinct from physics and chemistry, but if information is physical, these disciplines become more continuous. We might one day talk about the “thermodynamics of computation” or the “mechanics of adaptive systems” in unified terms – in fact, these exist in nascent forms, and IRE would accelerate their development.
   * Next steps for research and discussion would likely involve:
   1. Mathematical Development: Formalizing the IRE field equations for various systems and solving or simulating them. This could involve extending known equations (reaction-diffusion, nonlinear Schrödinger, Ginzburg-Landau, etc.) to include all the terms IRE suggests and checking for new predictions. Are there new pattern types or stability criteria that IRE yields? Does it perhaps predict novel resonance phenomena in complex systems?
   2. Experimental Validation: Designing experiments in, say, chemical systems, electronic circuits, or even social systems, where one can measure how information structure spreads or amplifies. One could, for example, create two identical copies of a complex system but seed a pattern in one and noise in the other, and see if the one with a pattern “recruits” more order as time goes on, as IRE would predict. In neuroscience, experiments could test whether artificially inducing coherence in certain brain areas yields cognitive changes in line with increased integration.
   3. Interdisciplinary Dialogues: Bringing together experts from physics, biology, computing, and philosophy to refine what we mean by information in each context and how to connect these definitions. Philosophers of information could help clarify whether IRE is implying a form of pancomputationalism (everything computes something) or paninformationalism (everything is information) and how that squares with metaphysics. Physicists would naturally be skeptical and want to see concrete models; engineers might try to harness any practical aspect (maybe designing better self-organizing materials).
   4. Philosophical Implications: On the more speculative side, discussing how IRE impacts our view of free will (if our choices are information patterns shaping outcomes, perhaps freedom can be seen as introducing new information?), or our understanding of purpose in the universe (IFE doesn’t necessarily imply purpose, but it does imply a tendency for complexity to rise under the right conditions, which can sound teleological). Such discussions need care to separate metaphor from mechanism, but they are important for a fundamental shift in worldview.
In closing, the Information Relative Evolution principle provides a rich, pedantic yet profoundly unifying narrative: it tells us that the universe is not just moving aimlessly according to blind forces, but is also continually informing itself, building up pockets of meaning and order. These pockets – be it a crystal, a DNA molecule, a brain, or a galaxy – are not accidents; they are natural outcomes when information is made an equal partner to matter and energy in the cosmic play. By being highly verbose and detailed in our exposition here, we aimed to leave no conceptual stone unturned, so that an educated reader can walk away with a complete and intuitive understanding of IRE. We treated abstract concepts with tangible analogies, and rigorous ideas with accessible language, in the spirit of a philosophical treatise that yet adheres to scientific thinking.
The fundamental shift advocated by IRE is to see patterns as causes, not just effects. If this shift is embraced, future scientists might look at a complex phenomenon and immediately think in terms of informational fields and their dynamics. They might see a living cell and not just enumerate molecules, but also map the information flows that keep it alive. They might analyze a market economy and, beyond goods and currency, chart the information coherence among agents that gives rise to booms and busts. In every case, they would be recognizing the physical reality of information.
To paraphrase a famous insight: “The Universe is not only made of atoms, but also of bits.” The IRE principle takes this seriously and provides a framework for how those bits behave and interact, relatively evolving to shape the cosmos. It is a young and ambitious idea, to be sure. It might require refinement or even radical revision as we explore it. But even in its nascent form, it holds the promise of connecting dots across disciplines, of infusing our understanding of reality with a new coherence – appropriately, an informational coherence in our knowledge itself.
In the end, whether one is a physicist pondering the foundations of quantum theory, a biologist marveling at self-organization in ecosystems, or a philosopher asking what underlies existence, the IRE principle offers a thought-provoking proposition: perhaps the missing ingredient in our picture of the world is the power of information made manifest. Embracing that could open doors to innovations in theory and technology that we are only beginning to imagine. As we proceed to investigate and debate this principle, the conversation itself enriches the informational tapestry of human knowledge, thereby practicing what IRE preaches – using coherence of information to propel us to new horizons of understanding.
